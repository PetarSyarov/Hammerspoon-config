HammerSpoon config for people who like having the "~" next to the number 1 key. Also for people who type in Bulgarian and want to have the "ч" right next to the number 1 key, just like in the Phonetic traditional keyboard layout on Windows.

Most of this was generated and tested over 1 week of vibe coding in LUA

I faced several issues when jumping between RDP sessions to Windows VMs and that forced me to have to reload the Hammerspoon config everytime, that's why the Watchdog function was added

Now after having used this config for over 3 months with no issues, I am sharing it on GitHub.
